# Kangaroo Twelve Implementation in Go

This is an implementation of [KangarooTwelve](http://keccak.noekeon.org/kangarootwelve.html) in Go.

It is heavily based on the official Go's [x/crypto/sha3](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/sha3) library. But because of minor implementation details the relevant files have been copied and modified here so you do not need Go's SHA-3 implementation to run this package. Hopefully one day Go's SHA-3 library will be more flexible to allow other keccak construction to rely on it.

I have tested this implementation with different test vectors and it works fine. Note that it has not received proper peer review. If you look at the code and find issues (or not) please [let me know](https://www.cryptologie.net/contact/)!

See here [why you should use KangarooTwelve instead of SHA-3](https://www.cryptologie.net/article/393/kangarootwelve/). But [see here first why you should still not skip SHA-3](https://www.cryptologie.net/article/400/maybe-you-shouldnt-skip-sha-3/).

## Installation

```sh
go get github.com/mimoo/GoKangarooTwelve/K12
```

## Usage

```go
package main

import(
    "fmt"
    "github.com/mimoo/GoKangarooTwelve/K12"
    "encoding/hex"
)

func main(){
    // custom string allows you to customize your hash function ðŸ™ƒ
    customString = []byte("davidwong.fr")
    hash := K12.NewK12(customString)

	// we absorb the payload
    payload := []byte("salut!")
    hash.Write(payload)

	// we squeeze a 32 output
    out := make([]byte, 32)
    hash.Read(out)

    fmt.Println(hex.EncodeToString(out))

    // or simpler with K12Sum()
    K12Sum(customString, payload, out)

    fmt.Println(hex.EncodeToString(out))
}
```

## Other Keccak-based things

I've implemented a few other constructions that might be helpful:

* [STROBE](https://github.com/mimoo/StrobeGo/blob/master/golang.org/x/crypto/sha3/strobe.go) 
* [cSHAKE](https://github.com/mimoo/StrobeGo/blob/master/golang.org/x/crypto/sha3/sp800-185.go)


# This is my section

K12.SumXXX() produces an output length of desired length

Current flavors are
```
Sum224(input []byte) - 28 byte length in []byte output
Sum256(input []byte) - 32 byte length in []byte output
Sum384(input []byte) - 48 byte length in []byte output
Sum512(input []byte) - 64 byte length in []byte output
```

More to be developed soon

New224/256/384/512 are on the menu, if warranted in the future
