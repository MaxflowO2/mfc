# Max Flow Chain

This is simply the bare bones and we progress further and further.

Currently what is done:<br>
Block<br>
Blockchain<br>
Database<br>
Bare bones Smart Contract language<br>

If you use the Makefile, should compile as of now (will actually roll this into a version).<br>

Dependancies Golang 1.16+, Java latest.<br>

To create type make... creates ./mfc<br>
To destroy type make clean (deletes database as well)<br>

./mfc is the binary<br>
blockchain.db is the database<br>
